# Bounties

From time-to-time we will add bounties for features.

These are generously provided by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) and as such employees of Parity or those of the W3F are ineligible for them. (This includes people being by either Party for development or community work, related or un-related to polkadot-js).

The idea is that these bounties should be left open to community participation, so only if there is no outside interest for a specific issue, should those directly or indirectly paid by the W3F for work, attempt to close an issue. (in which case it will be "un-bountied")

Current bounties are tracked by the [!bounty](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/labels/%21bounty) label.

## Process

Once listed, the normal [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) process kicks in. This means application, work and payment is managed by this tool. The values for bounties are determined by the size estimation done by the team.
