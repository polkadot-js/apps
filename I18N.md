# I18N

The apps UI allows all strings to be translated. Additionally it has a basic UI that allows for the creation of the required translation files, which will give an overview on the progress for a specific language.

## Updating translations

To update translations, the following process is required.

- launch the apps UI, either locally or via https://polkadot.js.org/apps
- explicitly navigate to the i18n page, https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings/i18n

Here you will find a dropdown of all the available languages and all the modules that maps to the UI. On a single screen you will be able to see all the available strings for a specific module.

- adjust any strings as required
- once completed with the changes, click the `Generate translation.json` button to download the translation file
- this file can now be added to the repo with a PR to https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/master/packages/apps/public/locales

## Adding a new language (if not in dropdown above)

The process is similar for the above, but does require a new folder with the language identifier to be added. Create [packages/apps/public/locales/<id>](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/master/packages/apps/public/locales) folder with an empty `translation.json` (containing only `{}`). After addition of the folder, run `yarn build:i18n` and then the new language will be available for update as per the process in the previous section.

In addition to the language folder, the language also needs to be added to the dropdown for available languages, this can be found in [packages/apps-config/src/settings/languages.ts](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/blob/master/packages/apps-config/src/settings/languages.ts)
