# @polkadot/apps

A Portal into the Polkadot network. Provides a view and interaction layer from a browser.

This can be accessed as a hosted application via [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) or via [https://poc-2.polkadot.io](https://poc-2.polkadot.io) with the latter not requiring a locally-hosted node.

## overview

The repo is split into a number of packages, each representing an application. These are -

- [apps](packages/apps/) This is the main entry point. It handles the selection sidebar and routing to the specific application being displayed.
- [app-accounts](packages/app-accounts/) A basic account management app.
- [app-addresses](packages/app-addresses/) A basic address management app.
- [app-explorer](packages/app-explorer/) A simple block explorer. It only shows the most recent blocks, updating as they become available.
- [app-extrinsics](packages/app-extrinsics/) Submission of extrinsics to a node.
- [app-rpc](packages/app-rpc/) Sumission of raw data to RPC endpoints.
- [app-staking](packages/app-staking/) A basic staking management app, allowing staking and nominations.
- [app-storage](packages/app-storage/) A simple node storage query application. Multiple queries can be queued and updates as new values become available.
- [app-toolbox](packages/app-toolbox/) Utilities to manage data.
- [app-vanitygen](packages/app-vanitygen/) A toy that allows you to generate vanity addresses. Running `yarn run vanitygen --match <string>` runs the generator as a Node CLI app. (Orders of a magnitude faster due to the use of libsoldium bindings)

In addition the following libraries are also included in the repo. These are to be moved to the [@polkadot/ui](https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui/) repository once it reaches a base level of stability and usability. (At this point with the framework being tested on the apps above, it makes development easier having it close)

- [ui-app](packages/ui-app/) A reactive (using RxJS) application framework with a number of useful shared components.
- [ui-keyring](packages/ui-keyring/) A browser-specific wrapper around the base [@polkadot/util-keyring](https://github.com/polkadot-js/util/) library.
- [ui-signer](packages/ui-signer/) Signer implementation for apps.
- [ui-identicon](packages/ui-identicon/) Identity icon generator with raw publicKey as input
- [ui-react](packages/ui-react) A collection of base React components
- [ui-react-rx](packages/ui-react-rx) Base components that use the RxJS Observable APIs

## development

Contributions are welcome!

To start off, this repo (along with others in the [@polkadot](https://github.com/polkadot-js/) family) uses yarn workspaces to organise the code. As such, after cloning dependencies _should_ be installed via `yarn`, not via npm, the latter will result in broken dependencies.

To get started -

1. Clone the repo locally, via `git clone https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps <optional local path>`
2. Ensure that you have a recent version of Node.js, for development purposes [Node >=10.1.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required.
3. Ensure that you have a recent version of Yarn, for development purposes [Yarn >=1.3.2](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) is required.
4. Install the dependencies by running `yarn`
5. Ready! Now you can launch the UI (assuming you have a local Polkadot Node running), via `yarn run start`
6. Access the UI via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Should you not run a local Node, you can connect to a remote node on the POC-2 network with the `WS_URL` environment variable. For example - the apps entry point can be launched with a WebSocket connection to Polkadot POC-2 with `WS_URL=wss://poc-2.polkadot.io:9944 yarn run start` and accessing the application of [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

There are additional environment UI flags that change both the theme and mode -

- Running with `UI_MODE=light|full` switches from a full (the default) to a light mode interface that only has specific applications highlighted.
- Running with `UI_THEME=substrate|polkadot` switches from a Polkadot theme (the default) to a Substrate-branded UI

## demos

Demos for the different libraries can be viewed with `yarn run demo:<name>` and then browsing to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Available demo -

- `yarn run demo:identicon`
- `yarn run demo:ui`
- `yarn run demo:rx`
