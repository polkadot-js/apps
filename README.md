# @polkadot/apps

A Portal into the Polkadot network. Provides a view and interaction layer from a browser.

This can be accessed as a hosted application via [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).

## overview

The repo is split into a number of packages, each representing an application. These are -

- [apps](packages/apps/) This is the main entry point. It handles the selection sidebar and routing to the specific application being displayed.
- [app-accounts](packages/app-accounts/) A basic account management app.
- [app-explorer](packages/app-explorer/) A simple block explorer. It only shows the most recent blocks, updating as they become available.
- [app-extrinsics](packages/app-extrinsics/) Submission of extrinsics to a node.
- [app-storage](packages/app-storage/) A simple node storage query application. Multiple queries can be queued and updates as new values become available.
- [app-vanitygen](packages/app-vanitygen/) A toy that allows you to generate vanity addresses. Running `yarn run vanitygen --match <string>` runs the generator as a Node CLI app. (Orders of a magnitude faster due to the use of libsoldium bindings)

In addition the following libraries are also included in the repo. These are to be moved to the [@polkadot/ui](https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui/) repository once it reaches a base level of stability and usability. (At this point with the framework being tested on the apps above, it makes development easier having it close)

- [ui-react-app](packages/ui-keyring/) A browser-specific wrapper around the base [@polkadot/util-keyring](https://github.com/polkadot-js/util/) libary.
- [ui-react-app](packages/ui-react-app/) A reactive (using RxJS) application framework with a number of useful shared components.
