For general support, howto, coding and bundling questions, please
use the Substrate & Polkadot StackExchange at

and get other ecosystem developers involved. This issues in this
repository are meant for the tracking of feature requests and bug
reports.

While all issues are looked at non-bug and non-features would take
quite a bit longer to get to and may yield less than satisfactory
responses in this format.

Additionally, please ensure you have done a search on the existing
and closed issues before logging a new request. This saves time on
all sides.
