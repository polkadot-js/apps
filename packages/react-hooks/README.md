# @polkadot/react-hooks

WARNING: This is an internal package to [polkadot-js/apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) so is not inteded (yet) for broad use. Since these are generic components, they will move to the [polkadot-js/ui](https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui) repo once deemed stable and usable.

For the existing sharable components usable in external React-based projects, take a look at the [polkadot-js/ui documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/ui/)
