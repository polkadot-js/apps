# What is Files?

Files is a Web3 IPFS file storage application built inside Polkadot-js/apps. Easy-to-use, lightweight and open-source.
With your Polkadot Wallet signed-in and just a few clicks, you can have your files uploaded and pinned to IPFS and get
more than dozens of replicas in a decentralized storage network offered by Crust, a substrate-based IPFS incentive layer
protocol.

# How to use

Files asks your Polkadot wallet (or any substrate-based wallet) for authentication. Connect your wallet in
Polkadot-js/apps and sign a message before uploading your files. Files is for now free of charge because Crust Network
will continue to fund Crust Pinner for its daily usage within normal limits.
