WARNING: This is is not deemed stable yet for external use in React-based apps and still included in the [polkadot-js/apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) repo. Since these are generic HOC components for React, they will move to the [polkadot-js/ui](https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui) repo once deemed stable and usable by external projects.

For the existing sharable components usable in external React-based projects, take a look at the [polkadot-js/ui documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/ui/)
