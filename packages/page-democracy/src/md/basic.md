# Democracy

This application lets you view proposals and vote for or against a referendum.
Anyone can create a proposal by bonding the minimum deposit for a certain period of time (No. of Blocks). If someone likes the proposal, they could deposit the same amount of tokens to support it. The minimum deposit is currently 5 Units/DOTs.

# Proposals

This lists the proposals that you can not vote on yet. The proposal with the highest amount of Units/DOTs supporting it will be selected in the next launch period for everyone to vote. This selected proposal evolved in a referendum. The tokens locked to support each proposal will be released once the proposal is tabled.

# Referendum

This lists the proposal that you can now vote for "aye" or against "nay".
At the end of the launch period, and depending on the outcome of the referendum, the action that was subjected to vote will be executed or rejected.
