# storage via API

In the [previous section](tut-002.md) we have used an HOC to query a storage area. Here we will repeat the same, however this time we will actually use the Rx API to accomplish the same goal.

# creating the component

As in previous examples, we will first show the [actual component](../packages/app-example/src/comp-003.tsx) we are using and then delve into how it fits together. Focussing on the meat of the API subscription that happens in the `componentMount` cycle -

```js
class Comp extends React.PureComponent<ApiProps, State> {
  ...
  // TODO We should unsubscribe from subscriptions
  componentDidMount () {
    this.subscribeProposals();
  }

  subscribeProposals () {
    const { api } = this.props;

    api.state
      .getStorage(storage.democracy.public.proposals)
      .subscribe((value: Array<StorageProposal>) => {
        this.setState({
          proposals: value.reduce((proposals: StateProposals, [propIdx, proposal, accountId]) => {
            const address = encodeAddress(accountId);

            if (!proposals[address]) {
              proposals[address] = [propIdx.toNumber()];
            } else {
              proposals[address].push(propIdx.toNumber());
            }

            return proposals;
          }, {} as StateProposals)
        });
      });
  }
  ...
}

export default withApi(Comp);
```

# walk-through

Since we are working on a slightly lower level now, a couple of things happen.

We use a helper function to decode the values as it comes back - without this we would just have a raw stream of bytes as retrieved from storage. The decding take the raw stream and splits it into a mangeable Array stream (based on trhe number of items), each containing a tuple of data - in this case the `PropIndex`, `Proposal` and `AccountId`.

Finally we loop through the proposals retrieved, indexing these by the actual account address - this information we finally use in the render to update the display.

The API provided on the component props is injected via `withApi`, to make an API query - subscribing to any updates. As any updates happen to the storage, these will be automatically fed through the API subscriptions, updating the component display.

# next up

In the next round, we will extend our subscriptions to also pull the information we previously got via HOC and then map [these together](tut-004.md).
