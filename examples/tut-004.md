# storage via API (part II)

[Previously](tut-002.md) we queried intentions via HOC, then [followed up](tut-003.md) with querying via API. Here we will replace our previous HOC component with the same storage queries.

# the component

Here we extend the component from the previous section, adding a subscription to intentions to create our [new component](../packages/app-example/src/comp-004.tsx) -

```js
class Comp extends React.PureComponent<ApiProps, State> {
  ...
  componentDidMount () {
    this.setState({
      subscriptions: [
        this.subscribeIntentions(),
        this.subscribeProposals()
      ]
    });
  }

  subscribeIntentions () {
    const { api } = this.props;

    return api.state
      .getStorage(storage.staking.public.intentions)
      .subscribe((intentions: StorageIntentions) => {
        this.setState({
          intentions: intentions.map(encodeAddress)
        });
      });
  }
  ...
}
```

# walk-through

This subscription is much simpler than what was found before, however it follows the same basic approach - query, transform the result.

# next steps

[Next up](tut-005.md), we will be using the actual data we have collected to render something useful on-screen.
