# examples

This guide will take you through some basic examples in using the Components and API to build tools to extract information from a Substrate network client. It follows the line of a set of tutorials that will setup basic infrastructure, queies and then string these together into doing some more complex things.

## tutorials

- [Basic application scaffolding](tut-001.md) Show the setup of a new app in this framework. (Typically only needed when new top-level features are added)
- [Storage and pulling from storage](tut-002.md) Shows how to use the built-in components to show something basic from storage
- [Querying storage via API](tut-003.md) Shows how to construct an API query to pull information from storage
